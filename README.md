=====

`sahieAPI` is an R client for Census Bureau's API for [**S**mall **A**rea **H**ealth **I**nsurance **E**stimates (SAHIE)](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Health-Insurance-Statistics.html):

> The Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program was created to develop model-based estimates of health insurance coverage for counties and states. SAHIE is only source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates for all U.S. counties. This program is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC), National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). The SAHIE program models health insurance coverage by combining survey data from several sources and then producing timely and accurate estimates of health insurance coverage. Additionally, the SAHIE program's age model methodology and estimates have undergone internal U.S. Census Bureau review as well as external review.

> The SAHIE program produces data for the following domains:

> -   Ages 0-64, 18-64, 40-64, and 50-64
> -   Female, male, and both sexes
> -   All incomes and income-to-poverty ratios (IPR) 0-138, 0-200, 0-250, 0-400, and 138-400 percent of the poverty threshold
> -   For states only: White not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, and Hispanic (any race)
